# Random Generated Data

Welcome to the Random Generated Data repository! Here you'll find randomly generated data available in both SQL and CSV formats.

## Files

- `random_generated_data.sql`: Contains SQL INSERT statements for the generated data.
- `random_generated_data.csv`: Contains the generated data in CSV format.

## Code Information

The data generation and file creation were implemented in Python. Additionally, a Flask web application was added to allow users to generate and download data through a user-friendly interface.

- **Language**: Python
- **Version**: 3.x
- **Libraries Used**: `random`, `csv`, `datetime`, `Flask`

## Usage

You can utilize the generated data in your projects for various purposes such as testing, development, or any other tasks as per your needs. With the Flask web application, you can now conveniently generate and download data through a browser interface.

## Instructions

Follow these simple steps to get started:

1. Clone or download this repository to your local machine.
2. Optionally, customize the Python script `generator.py` to adjust the data generation process according to your specific requirements.
3. Run the Flask web application by executing the `app.py` script. Access the application through your web browser at the provided address.
4. Use the user-friendly interface to select the desired data fields, specify the number of data entries, and choose the file format (SQL or CSV) for download.
5. Alternatively, you can still generate fresh random data using the Python script if preferred.

Feel free to modify the Python script according to your requirements.
